# Native diversity buffers against severity of non-native tree invasions globally 

This repository contains scripts for the data preparation and parts of the analysis of the paper "Native diversity buffers against severity of non-native tree invasions globally". 

The repository contains three main folders: 
* **01_DataPrep** contains scripts for the merging the necessary database information included in the analysis of this paper (GFBI, GloNAF, Kew, BCGI) and to compute diversity metrics
* **02_Analysis** contains scripts for parts of the main analysis done for the paper


## Data used
### Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative (GFBI)
GFBI studies and manages the world’s largest tree-level forest inventory [database](https://gfbinitiative.net/). The data includes over 1.2 million plots from more than 70 countries in all the continents except for Antarctica.

### Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI)
The GlobalTree Portal indentifies species names as trees, by defining trees as: “A woody plant with usually a single stem growing to a height of at least two metres, or if multi-stemmed, then at least one vertical stem five centimetres in diameter at breast height”.

### Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF)
GloNAF is a [database](https://glonaf.org/) project about naturalized alien plant species. It includes 13,939 taxa which accounts for approx. 4% of the extant global flora. Spatially, GloNAF covers 1,029 regions (including 381 islands) including all terrestrial regions of the globe.

### Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
The Plants of the World Online (POWO) provides information on the distribution of vascular plants worldwide. It outlines native ranges of vascular plant species for over 1.2 million plant species.
