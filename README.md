## Data used
### Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative (GFBI)
contains tree-level abundance data for more than 1.2 million forest plots on all continents across the globe, containing more than 31 million unique georeferenced records of tree size and density dating from 1958 [database](https://gfbinitiative.net/).

### Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI)
The GlobalTree Portal indentifies species as trees, by defining trees as: “A woody plant with usually a single stem growing to a height of at least two metres, or if multi-stemmed, then at least one vertical stem five centimetres in diameter at breast height”.

### Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF)
The GloNAF database is a recently published database which contains detailed, georeferenced information on the naturalized status of more than 10,000 plant species in each of 1,029 regions across the globe representing countries or federal states [database](https://glonaf.org/).

### Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
The Plants of the World Online (POWO) KEW database outlines native ranges of vascular plant species for over 1.2 million plant species.
